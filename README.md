# Sentiment_Analyzer
In this project I have used twitter data to analyze the sentiments of twitter users towards the Indian political giants Narendra Modi and
Rahul Gandhi.
I have basically categorized the tweeted words simply in four categories viz. Positive, Negative, Neutral and Compound.
The categorization of words is basically done on the basis of "Lexicon Method".
You can read about Lexicon Method here:- https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-lexicon-based-approach-used-in-sentiment-analysis

Importants point :-
In order the analyze the sentiments, you must gain access to twitter data. In order to do so, you have to sign up for twitter developer
account, and create a new app there.
Then you will be provided four keys which will be used in further process.
